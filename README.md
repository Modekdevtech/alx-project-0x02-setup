\# Next.js Project Setup and Basics



This repository contains the foundational setup for a modern web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as the starting point for learning how to structure a scalable Next.js project while exploring core concepts such as routing, reusable components, API integration, and responsive UI development.



The goal of this repository is to provide a clean and organized base from which more complex features will be added in later project stages.
